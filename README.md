## ðŸ§  What I Did

### âœ… SQL (BigQuery)
- Wrote **8 custom queries** to answer key business questions
- Built **two advanced funnel models**:
  - **Session-Level Funnel**: What happened in one visit
  - **User-Level Funnel**: Did they come back and complete the journey?

### âœ… Power BI
- Designed a 4-page dashboard with clean navigation
- Created custom DAX measures (revenue trends, funnel metrics, traffic share, etc.)
- Used conditional formatting and filters to make the story clear at a glance

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Matters

This is more than just querying data â€” itâ€™s about **thinking like a BI Developer**:
- Knowing which KPIs to track
- Building systems to monitor funnel health
- Telling a story with data that decision-makers can act on

This was the first project in my BI portfolio, and I built it with care and clarity. The funnel analysis here simulates real business problems â€” drop-offs, missed revenue, customer paths â€” and sets a foundation for conversion rate optimization and better marketing decisions.

## ðŸ”— More Coming Soon

This is part of a full BI portfolio Iâ€™m building. Future projects will include:
- Multi-source retail sales analysis
- Campaign performance tracking
- Advanced cohort & segmentation analysis

Stay tuned â€” more case studies and dashboards on the way.
